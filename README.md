# CS342-Recursion
# author - Jeremiah Johnson 


This project was a college assignment for my Data Structures course, which focuses on recursion. This assignment has 
two parts to it: (1) to implement a program that prints a pattern of n lines of asterisks recursively, 
and (2) convert a character of strings into an integer, recursively. I've created two classes "Asterisk" and
"StringtoInt" which contains my solution.
